---Developpers
 ==Controllers
    * Pause/unpause game
    * Use a library to play ogg vorbis instead of wav (or use directly midi files for background music)

 ==Model
    * Some veggies seem to die without ever appearing
    * Menu

 ==View
    * Correct the colorization (it's a little sketchy)
    * Implements an internalization system
    
 ==Misc
    * Translate code & documentation
    * Start screen
    * .deb, .rpm, ... archives for Linuxians :)

---Non-developpers
    * Design a menu (New game, Save/Load game, ...)
    * Sound effects
    * More coherent (and prettier) sprites
    * Write a better README.md
