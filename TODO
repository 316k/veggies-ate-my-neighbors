---Developpers
    * Translate code & documentation
    * Make suns appear at random in the field (seems broken)
    * Correct the colorization (it's a little sketchy)
    * Menu (Save/Load game)
    * Start screen

---Non-developpers
    * Sound effects
    * More coherent sprites
    * Write a better README.md
